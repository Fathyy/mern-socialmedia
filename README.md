# This is my project
I am a beginner in React and I am trying to create a simple game where the user has to 
guess a number between 1 and 100. The user has 5 chances to guess the number
correctly. If the user guesses the number correctly, the game ends and the user
wins. If the user uses up all 5 chances without guessing the number correctly, the
game ends and the user loses.
